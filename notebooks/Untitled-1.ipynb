One day, she met a fairy who told her that what was most truly valuable was often underrated. The princess thought about this for a long time and finally decided to try to be nicer to the people around her. She started small, by just saying \"Hello\" to people she passed in the halls, but eventually she made some friends and began to feel better about herself. The princess learned that what is most truly valuable is often underrated, and that it's worth trying to be a bit nicer to the people around you.\n"
